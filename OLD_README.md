### Hello there! 👋

I'm a dedicated **full-stack developer** who finds joy in crafting solutions, whether it's building a dynamic website or a simple command-line tool. Beyond coding, I'm also a creative professional specializing in **motion graphics** and **music video creation** for the VTuber community.

### 🔧 Tech Stack & Creative Toolkit

I work with a variety of languages and tools to bring my ideas to life.

* **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, PHP, CSS, HTML, and I'm currently diving into Go.
* **Web Frameworks**: React, Express.js, Laravel.
* **Creative Software**: Adobe After Effects (for motion and video), and Photoshop (for graphics).

### 🚀 My Projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of:

* [Yubisaki](https://github.com/kureichi/Yubisaki) (JS, React): A frontend for a simple chat AI, built with a focus on clean architecture.
* [GoMCLauncher](https://github.com/Kuredew/GoMCLauncher) (Go): A lightweight, text-based Minecraft launcher. This is a work in progress.
* [cli-dl](https://github.com/Kuredew/cli-dl) (Python): A powerful command-line downloader that uses YT-DLP to give you control over video quality directly in your terminal.
* [Adobe Discord RPC](https://github.com/Kuredew/adobe-discord-rpc) (JS): An extension that shows what Adobe project you're working on as your Discord status.

### 🤝 Teamwork & Contributions

I actively collaborate on projects, such as the [laravel-crud](https://github.com/Kuredew/laravel-crud) web app, where I helped maintain the codebase, find bugs, and improve functionality. I'm passionate about writing clean, efficient code and exploring new technologies.
